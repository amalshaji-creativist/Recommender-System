			Royal Textile Museum (open between 09:00 am – 04:30 pm during summer and till 03:30 hrs. during winters, closed on weekends and govt. holidays): is worth a visit to get to know the living national art of weaving.

The site of the temple was a former battle ground, and the temple was constructed there in order to pacify energies.
			Simply Bhutan Museum: (open between 09:00 am – 05:00 pm) This privately owned museum depicts the ancient Bhutanese architecture which is being lost to modernization.  The uniqueness of the structure is in its composition of the materials used.
