# Recommender-System
This is a recommendation system for travel packages.
Here I have used 12 spiders to scrap data from 12 websites. All these are travel packages data around the world.I have made a content based recommendation system, which recommends new travel packages based on the user input.(the places they love or where they have gone).

Contents:
1. d1.csv -d12.csv ---All 12 datasets I scraped and used to make the recommender system
2. recommender_system.py --------- The python program for recommender system
3. places.py ------------------A sample spider I have created
4. travel.zip -----------------I have used 12 spiders to create 12 datasets all are compressed and can be found here.
