The Golden Circle tour allows you to visit some of Iceland‘s most stunning sights, Geysir geothermal area, the waterfall Gullfoss, and the UNESCO site Þingvellir National Park as well as to learn about growing vegetables in a country which doesn’t get much daylight for most of the year. Geysir geothermal area is in South Iceland, near Laugarvatn Lake. The area is named after the biggest, and now mostly dormant, geyser Geysir and all geysers in the world owe their name to it. The biggest attraction today is the active Strokkur, which shoots up a column of water up to 30 metres (98 ft.) into the air every few minutes. Gullfoss is one of the most famous waterfalls in Iceland and rightly so. The three-step waterfall is a part of the glacial river Hvita and falls into a 62-metre (105 ft.) deep canyon. For the first half of the 20th century, there were ideas about using the waterfall to generate electricity, but thankfully nothing came of it. The UNESCO site Þingvellir National Park is geologically and historically significant. Apart from being the location of the oldest parliament in the world, Alþingi, it is also a place where you can see the Mid-Atlantic ridge above ground. The Eurasian and North -American tectonic plates pull the country apart by a couple of centimeters per year.

The beautiful sand and shallow, clear water are well-suited to relaxing beach days under the sun; the beautiful underwater scenery lends itself well to snorkelling or scuba diving; the widespread bay means that you can easily try out some surfing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, or jet skiing without disturbing others; and finally, the numerous excursions and rental options here mean that the only limit is what you want to spend your day doing. 
				 
				Beau Vallon is also worth a visit in the evening thanks to the beautiful sunset views over the water, as well as the local restaurants and bars, including a nightclub, that can be found next to the beach. With such a variety of different things to do, it’s little wonder that Beau Vallon is so well-known by tourists and locals alike, and this beach is one of the few ‘must-see’ locations for any Seychelles vacationer.

With a population of just over 2000 and a rich flora, La Digue is home to one of the rarest birds on earth - the Paradise Flycatcher. Known for preserving traditions, the island’s ‘trademark’ is the must-visit l’Union Estate, still sporting its traditional coconut oil mill, the old copra kiln and a fine colonial house set amongst vanilla and coconut plantations. 
	As you stroll along, pet the gentle giant land tortoises before settling

		Arrival in Whistler. The drive north from Vancouver to Whistler is stunning. It’s dubbed the Sea to Sky Highway and although it’s only a two-hour trip, we recommend taking all day because of the stellar must-see attractions en route. Once in Whistler, enjoy the alpine resort’s all-season activities. Whatever the season its the activities that make people flock here.
		 
	
		Start your day with PEAK 2 PEAK, world’s longest and highest gondola ride, stretching kilometers between the two mountains some 435 meters up. The views through its large windows are outrageous, and some gondola cars even have a glass floor. Ride any time of year to sightsee, spot wildlife, or hop between peaks, and dine at one of the five restaurants up top. Waffles with a view on the patio of log-cabin-style Crystal Hut are a must. Cafeteria-style Roundhouse Lodge is another popular choice for its food courts serving pretty much any international cuisine you can think of.  There’s a gallery explaining the sophisticated engineering behind PEAK 2 PEAK and a 2010 Winter Games display, plus a cinema screening alpine films. Summer and fall are optimal for over 50 kilometers of hikes and walks from the top, especially the popular half-day High Note Trail. Later,  fly through the forest on an exhilarating high wire adventure, no experience required. Glide over spectacular creeks and through majestic old-growth trees on a guided tour. In the evening, stroll through the Whistler Village.  In winter, the covered walkways let you meander from gallery to shop without slipping and sliding alongside skiers and snowshoers.  In summer, the cobblestone streets are lined with bountiful floral baskets and filled with busker entertainment.
		 
	 
	
		Journey deep into the backcountry as your ride on tight bush and open forest trails to a remote alpine cabin nestled on a serene mountain lake. As you relax after your ATV ride, you'll be able to take in the scenery and kick back, all while enjoying a BBQ lunch at your own private oasis. This tour  the perfect group outing for families & friends. Later, ride the melt water from the mountains on a fast, fun whitewater rafting tour. Paddle hard or hold on and enjoy the ride while certified guides navigate you safely through the rapids. Tours include transportation to and from Whistler, wetsuit, gear, professional guide and lunch on full day tours.

	Welcome to Bali. Upon your arrival, meet our representative at the arrival hall who will escort you till your private car. 
	Enjoy continental breakfast in the Hotel. Proceed to visit Uluwatu The Kecak dance , or 'Tari Kecak with ullu, is a captivating traditional Balinese art performance, which also goes by, ‘the monkey chant dance’, and loosely 'fire dance', for its occasional use of fire as a centrepiece prop. The Kecak was created around 1930 and is now internationally recognised as one of Bali’s top-three signature dances (alongside the Barong and Legong). The Kecak dance is unique in that it has no other musical background or accompaniment besides the chanting of male dancers, intoning a “keh-chack” polyrhythmic choir during most of the performance. Kecak’s storyline is taken from the Ramayana Hindu epic and it’s often on the entertainment schedule of almost every Balinese arts and culture venue. Overnight stay at the hotel.
