Take a stroll in the center of this small town, which is also the capital located to the north of the world. You can ask at the reception of your hotel for a wakeup call show of the Northern Light. Overnight in the Klettur Hotel or similar.
	Breakfast in the hotel. Enjoy the Golden Circle Excursion. The Golden Circle tour allows you to visit some of Iceland‘s most stunning sights, Geysir geothermal area, the waterfall Gullfoss, and the UNESCO site Þingvellir National Park as well as to learn about growing vegetables in a country which doesn’t get much daylight for most of the year. Geysir geothermal area is in South Iceland, near Laugarvatn Lake. The area is named after the biggest, and now mostly dormant, geyser Geysir and all geysers in the world owe their name to it. The biggest attraction today is the active Strokkur, which shoots up a column of water up to 30 metres (98 ft.) into the air every few minutes. Gullfoss is one of the most famous waterfalls in Iceland and rightly so. The three-step waterfall is a part of the glacial river Hvita and falls into a 62-metre (105 ft.) deep canyon. For the first half of the 20th century, there were ideas about using the waterfall to generate electricity, but thankfully nothing came of it. The UNESCO site Þingvellir National Park is geologically and historically significant. Apart from being the location of the oldest parliament in the world, Alþingi, it is also a place where you can see the Mid-Atlantic ridge above ground. The Eurasian and North -American tectonic plates pull the country apart by a couple of centimeters per year.
	
		
			
				Breakfast in the hotel. Enjoy the South Shore Excursion. South Iceland is special for that it is one of the flattest regions on the island. Because of that, most of all grain farming in Iceland is done there. The high mountains to the north, shield the area from the harshest winds from the north. Among the stops on this tour are at the gorgeous Seljalandsfoss and Skogafoss waterfalls. Seljalandsfoss is part of the Seljandsa river, which has its origins in Eyjafjallajokull glacier. What makes Seljalandsfoss so famous and interesting is that you can walk behind it. We recommend you bring either a raincoat or a waterproof coat along if you want to walk behind it.
