The beaches around the island are all dreamlike, picture postcards of white sand and shallow, turquoise seas, with famous names like Anse Lazio and Anse Geogette frequently making top ten lists of best beaches and most beautiful destinations worldwide. We would definitely recommend visiting either or both the beaches.

Continue by boat to Curieuse Island, where you will visit the old Doctor’s House which has been turned into a museum and the pen for rearing giant land tortoises. Later on we will stop for snorkeling off the boat near the St. Pierre Island which is a natural aquarium. Discover the multitudes of corals and fish and if you are lucky swim, with the turtles andthe eagle rays. There are no jetties, so be prepared for wet landing.
	 
	If you take a tour of La digue, be prepared to be amazed by the sheer beauty of this island. La Digue is the fourth largest island of the Seychelles group. Here, time stands still and the use of bicycles and ox-cart are quite prevalent. With a population of just over 2000 and a rich flora, La Digue is home to one of the rarest birds on earth - the Paradise Flycatcher. Known for preserving traditions, the island’s ‘trademark’ is the must-visit l’Union Estate, still sporting its traditional coconut oil mill, the old copra kiln and a fine colonial house set amongst vanilla and coconut plantations. 
	 
	As you stroll along, pet the gentle giant land tortoises before settling down on the picturesque Anse Source d’Argent, voted as one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Set against exceptional rock formation, the place remains a source of inspiration for artists and will simply take away your breath. Relax and take memorable pictures of one of the few natural places in the world where you can hear your heart beating!

	Welcome to Seychelles- an unmatched paradise on earth. Once you land in Mahe Island we will whisk you away to your hotel (Le Relax) situated in Anse Royale across the best snorkelling beach in the south of Mahe. You have the whole day to explore your beautiful resort and the Anse Royale beach.

				After a leisurely breakfast we would recommend visiting one or two of the pristine 65 beaches in Mahe, our suggestion- Beau Vallon Beach. One of the longest beaches in the Seychelles, Beau Vallon is popular amongst tourists and locals thanks to its mixture of beautiful scenery, extensive activity options, fantastic surrounding infrastructure, and widespread appeal. The sheer choice of different activities at Beau Vallon is unique in the Seychelles. The beautiful sand and shallow, clear water are well-suited to relaxing beach days under the sun; the beautiful underwater scenery lends itself well to snorkelling or scuba diving; the widespread bay means that you can easily try out some surfing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, or jet skiing without disturbing others; and finally, the numerous excursions and rental options here mean that the only limit is what you want to spend your day doing. 
				 
				Beau Vallon is also worth a visit in the evening thanks to the beautiful sunset views over the water, as well as the local restaurants and bars, including a nightclub, that can be found next to the beach. With such a variety of different things to do, it’s little wonder that Beau Vallon is so well-known by tourists and locals alike, and this beach is one of the few ‘must-see’ locations for any Seychelles vacationer.
				Overnight at Hotel
	After breakfast, you have the rest of the day at leisure. We recommend visiting the nearby islands of Praslin or La Digue. 
	La Digue is the fourth largest island of the Seychelles group. Here, time stands still and the use of bicycles and ox-cart are quite prevalent. With a population of just over 2000 and a rich flora, La Digue is home to one of the rarest birds on earth - the Paradise Flycatcher. Known for preserving traditions, the island’s ‘trademark’ is the must-visit l’Union Estate, still sporting its traditional coconut oil mill, the old copra kiln and a fine colonial house set amongst vanilla and coconut plantations. 
	As you stroll along, pet the gentle giant land tortoises before settling
	down on the picturesque Anse Source d’Argent, voted as one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Set against exceptional rock formation, the place remains a source of inspiration for artists and will simply take away your breath. Relax and take memorable pictures of one of the few natural places in the world where you can hear your heart beating!
	 
	With over 7000 inhabitants, Praslin is the second largest of the archipelago covers an area of over 37sqm. The isle of Praslin boasts one of UNESCO’s World Heritage sites, the renowned Vallée de Mai, believed to be the original ‘Garden of Eden’. As you stroll through this amazing forest, meet the World’s biggest nut, the inspiring Coco de Mer. Your tour will then take you to the exquisite Anse Lazio beach which over recent years has appeared on the list of top 10 beaches in the world and has graced the front page of several publications. Your visit to these two islands will not only be a dream come true, but a memorable experience for you will have been seduced!
